                    <p class="mb-4 " style="margin-top: 50px;">A box office or ticket office is a place where tickets are sold to the public for admission to an event. Patrons may perform the transaction at a countertop, through a hole in a wall or window, or at a wicket. By extension, the term is frequently used, especially in the context of the film industry, as a metonym for the amount of business a particular production, such as a film or theatre show, receives.
                    </p>
                    <p>Box office business can be measured in the terms of the number of tickets sold or the amount of money raised by ticket sales (revenue). The projection and analysis of these earnings is greatly important for the creative industries and often a source of interest for fans. This is predominant in the <code>Hollywood movie industry</code> .</p>

            <p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">
              The 1970s saw a resurgence in Hollywood filmmaking, with a number of blockbusters, successful sequels, and major franchises being released in the late 1970s. One of the main reasons for this was the rise of the summer movie season, with films such as Star Wars (1977) and Jaws (1975) becoming major box office successes. This increased interest in films led to more major studios investing in films, as well as independent filmmakers creating low-budget films with the potential for major success. Additionally, the rise of home video and cable television also contributed to the increased production of films in Hollywood.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">The primary reason for the dramatic increase in the production of Hollywood movies between 2001 and 2010 is the rise of digital filmmaking technology. Digital filmmaking technology has revolutionized the movie industry, making it much easier and more affordable to produce high-quality movies. With digital technology, filmmakers can now shoot and edit movies on a computer, eliminating the need for expensive film stock and post-production costs. Digital cameras are also much smaller and lighter, making it easier to shoot on location and in difficult environments. Finally, digital technology has allowed filmmakers to create special effects and visuals that weren't possible before. All of these factors have contributed to the growing popularity of digital filmmaking and the explosion in the number of movies being produced in Hollywood.

<p style="font-family:serif">These amazing ten Hollywood movies are the top earners in terms of sales amount!
  As you take a look at the top 10 movies, you can see that over the past few decades, the highest grossing movie was Titanic from 1997 and the most recent one was Avengers from 2019. But the movie that truly stands out is the Star Wars : The Force Awakens movie from 2015, as it made a whopping 9.3 billion dollars in sales!
   an impressive majority of them(7 out of 10) were produced by the BV Studio. It's amazing to think about how these films have made such an impact on the industry in terms of sales. It's a testament to the hard work of the studios and filmmakers who created them.

<P class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">After getting acquainted with BV Studio, I would like to draw your attention to the top ten studios in terms of film production. As you can see, the top five studios produced more than 500 films and the next five produced less than 500 films. WB Studio is in the first place with 817 films. In this ranking, you see BV Studio in the fifth place with 580 films; however, as you have already seen, BV Studio has produced the best-selling films.
</P>


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6"><p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">Regarding the amount of studio sales, as you can see in the chart below, Studio BV is in first place with sales of 44.3 billion dollars, and WB studio is in second place with 39.2 billion dollars. Furthermore, four studios have sales of less than 10 billion dollars, with Col studio having the lowest at 5.7 billion dollars.
  This demonstrates a clear divide between the top two studios and the other four.
</p>
<p class="mt-2" style="font-family:serif">In the graph that shows the number of studios over time, you can see that there was not much change in the number of film studios  producing Hollywood movies from 1921 to 1981.
  In 1981, the first jump in the number of studios happened, the reasons for which can be as follows: First, the rise of the home video market in the early 1980s enabled studios to make more money from their films. This meant that there was an increased incentive for studios to produce more films and invest in larger productions.

Second, the introduction of cable television in the mid-1980s provided studios with a new outlet to show their films and to make money from them.</p>

  <p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">Also, the second jump was in 1994, the reasons for which could be as follows:
    - the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) allowed Hollywood studios to access a larger market in Mexico and Canada, which further increased the potential revenues from their films. 
    Finally, the technological advancements of the 1990s enabled studios to create more sophisticated visual effects and soundtracks, which made their movies more appealing to audiences. This led to an increased demand for Hollywood movies, which in turn encouraged more studios to invest in their production.</p>

  <div class="row mt-5 mb-5">
  <p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">In the last part, we presented a pie chart showing the number of studios based on the number of films they produced and their income. As you can see, the largest number of studios (129) produced between 1 and 10 films, while only 5 studios produced more than 500 films.

  <div class="col-md-6" id ="chart222" style="width: 80%;height:300px;"></div>

<p class="mt-5" style="font-family:serif">In the pie chart that shows the income of studios, you can see that only 45 films earned between $100 million and $1 billion, while most studios (311) earned between $10,000 and $100,000, and 281 studios earned between $100,000 and $1 million.

  This suggests that the majority of studios make a relatively small amount of money from their films. Most of the income is generated by a select few studios that have managed to produce films that have earned between $100 million and $1 billion. This further highlights the importance of success in the film industry, as even a small number of highly successful films can generate significant profits.</p>
<p class="aa mt-5">Conclusion:</p>
  <p class="" style="font-family:serif ;"> Hollywood's movie industry has grown tremendously since 1921, with 16,542 films produced and a staggering 293.8 billion dollars earned from box office sales. Digital filmmaking technology has revolutionized the industry, making it much easier and more affordable to produce films. BV Studio stands out, as it has produced seven of the top ten highest-grossing films, and it has earned 44.3 billion dollars in sales. The technological advancements of the 1990s and the rise of home video and cable television have contributed to the increased production of films in Hollywood. However, the majority of studios produce films that generate relatively small amounts of money, demonstrating the importance of success in the film industry.
